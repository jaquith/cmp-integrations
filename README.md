# Tealium iQ Consent Integrations

A series of integrations between the Tealium iQ Tag Manager and various Consent Management Platforms (CMPs).

This repo was originally for the prototype; the approach is now productized: https://docs.tealium.com/iq-tag-management/consent-integrations/ 

That means you don't need the code in this repo. The only exception is if you're using a draft in the 'extensions-2' folder to test a new integrations, in which case you'll have gotten a specific link to the relevant file from someone at Tealium already.
